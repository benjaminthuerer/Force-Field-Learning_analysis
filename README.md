# Force-Field-Learning_analysis
Load, preprocess, and analyze c3d data from robotic manipulanda (e.g. Kinarm Endpoint-Lab). Whole analysis uses Matlab and the BTK toolbox.

<b>The code is specialized for the experiments I have conducted during my PhD thesis and should not be used without knowing what you do!</b>

If you want to use this as a start for your own analysis, make sure you change the CSV files and how they are called and used in the code. Or just ask me ;-)
